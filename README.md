# NLP
## Geographic vs. Non-Geographic Text Classification
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify text documents into two categories: geographic and non-geographic. The workflow involves text extraction, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction.

## Technologies and Tools

Python: Programming language used for implementation.
NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit, used for text processing.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training and evaluation.
PyPDF2: Library used for extracting text from PDF documents.
Google Colab: Optional platform for running the Jupyter notebook.

## Project Structure

notebooks/Geographic_Text_Classification.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing code, explanations, and results.
data/: Directory for storing sample data files.
src/: Directory containing Python scripts for modular code.
preprocessing.py: Contains functions for text preprocessing.
classifier.py: Contains the classifier and related functions.
requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies needed for the project.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Amirhatamian/The-Classification-of-Texts-using-Wikipedia.ipynb.git
cd The-Classification-of-Texts-using-Wikipedia.ipynb
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook:
bash
Copy code
## jupyter notebook notebooks/The-Classification-of-Texts-using-Wikipedia.ipynb.ipynb

## Solution Steps

Text Extraction: Extract text from Wikipedia articles and PDF documents using PyPDF2.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization) using NLTK.
Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
Model Training: Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the preprocessed text data using scikit-learn.
Prediction: Classify new text documents using the trained model.

## Example Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook.
Run the cells to preprocess the text, train the classifier, and classify new documents.

## Large Language Model (LLM) Summarization
## Project Overview
This project involves implementing an algorithm to generate a summarization of an input text that follows the style of another text. The algorithm handles long texts by summarizing them hierarchically.

## Technologies and Tools

Python (using NLTK) or Java (using OpenNLP): Programming languages and respective libraries used for implementation.
LLM: Large Language Model for handling the context window and summarization tasks.

## Summarization Pipeline

Measure the length of the two documents.

Compute target lengths proportional to the lengths of the documents.

Slice the second document within the context window.

Summarize the slice without specifying a target size.

Repeat slicing and summarizing until the end of the document.

Collate the summaries.

Repeat the process until the summary is within the context window.

Save the document.

Repeat summarization for the second document.

Generate the final query.

## Implementation Details
Length Measurement: Determine the lengths of the documents.
Target Length Calculation: Compute target lengths based on document proportions.
Document Slicing: Slice the second document to fit within the context window.
Hierarchical Summarization: Summarize each slice and collate the results.
Summary Collation: Combine all summaries into a cohesive document.
Query Generation: Create the final summarized document.

## Example Usage
Implement the summarization algorithm in Python or Java.
Run the algorithm with the provided input texts.
Generate the summarized output following the style of the input text.
